<H2>About Me</H2>

<p>
Hi! I'm a postdoc at the <a href="http://andreashellander.se/">Hellander Lab</a> at Uppsala University (Sweden) for the <a href="http://haste.research.it.uu.se/">HASTE project</a>.
I work on novel workflows and pipelines for handling large hierarchical spatial-temporal datasets;
related optimization problems in cloud computing, especially cloud-edge communication and storage of large matrix streams, with applications in microscopy and systems biology.
</p>

<p>
I currently teach <a href="http://www.uu.se/en/admissions/freestanding-courses/course-syllabus/?kpid=4548&type=1">Script Programming (Python)</a>,
and lecture on Apache Spark for the <a href="http://www.uu.se/en/admissions/master/selma/kursplan/?kKod=1TD268&lasar=">Large Datasets for Scientific Applications</a> course.
